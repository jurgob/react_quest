## React lesson
This is a quick guide about React.
The idea is to drive you into React's world  in the most practical and fast way possible.

## if you have questions...
just open a ticket, if it's a question releted to a specific lession (e.g. lession 1) name the ticket starting with [LESSON X], like:
[LESSON 1] - waaat?

## when you will publish the next lesson?
dunno, when I will have time to do them :P

## will you talk about XXX?
check "next" branch, lessons.md in particular, there's a "track" of the lessions I've in mind (link here: https://github.com/jurgob/react_quest/blob/next/lessons.md)

## be up-to-date regarding react_quest
subscribe to @react_quest telegram channel (link here: https://telegram.me/reactquest) to be updated (or star the project and follow github notifications)

## DISCLAIMER:
As anyone I don't have so mutch time, so probabily I'll do a lot of errors, so pass it over if they are not important or open a ticket.
