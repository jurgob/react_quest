#Lesson One:
Create your first React App.

Be sure to have node (version 6) installed

```
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app mandi-mond
```
This process could take a while. When everything is done:

```
cd mandi-mond
npm start
```

This will open the browser.

Now, open App.js and change "Welcome to React" to "mandi mond"

No refresh in the browser is needed.

You did it!
